# Dataset
The dataset consist of 20 observations and 2205 attributes of the condition assessment of a hydraulic test rig based on multi sensor data which was experimentally obtained. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank 1, 2. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied.

# Summary of Findings
The data exploration revealed important findings about the system's cooling performance. On average, the cooling efficiency was recorded at 32.32Hz, and the maximum cooling power reached 2.8Hz. Interestingly, the cooling efficiency showed an initial increase, peaking after approximately 45,000 seconds before stabilizing. Similarly, the cooling power exhibited a rise following the same timeframe, but then experienced a visible decline. The analysis also highlighted the relationship between vibration, pressure, and temperature. Vibration was found to have a positive impact on temperature, meaning that higher vibration levels correlated with higher temperatures. Conversely, pressure had an inverse effect on temperature, indicating that increased pressure resulted in lower temperatures within the system.

# Key Insights for Presentation
1. The system demonstrated an average cooling efficiency of 32.32Hz and a maximum cooling power of 2.8Hz.
2. Cooling efficiency initially increased and reached a peak after about 45,000 seconds before stabilizing, indicating an optimal operational time.
3. Cooling power followed a similar trend, rising after approximately 45,000 seconds but then showing a visible decline.
4. Vibration in the system had a positive relationship with temperature, meaning higher vibration levels correlated with higher temperatures.
5. Pressure had an inverse effect on temperature, with increased pressure resulting in lower temperatures within the system.

These insights provide valuable information about the system's cooling performance, its behavior over time, and the impact of vibration and pressure on temperature
